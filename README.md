For this project, you may complete a program application of your choice.

Program Criteria
Your program must include at least one of each of the following in a meaningful way:

- if statements
- loops
- arrays (lists)
- files
- functions
Your submission to this project will have four parts which follow the Programming Design Cycle. All four parts will be submitted at one time and should be 12-font New Times Roman, double spaces, and APA formatting. Include citations. 

Part 1 – Understanding the Problem [ 25 points ]
Clearly write a full description of what your program will do. Include prompts and samples of user input, as well as output that will be printed to the screen or to a file. Give an overall description of the flow of the program, and include a flow chart with all prompts and outputs as part of your submission. (minimum 300 words)

Part 2 – Planning the Logic [ 25 points ]
Write the pseudocode that implements the program described in your submission for Part 1 – Understanding the Problem. Be sure to include comments, variable declarations, descriptive variable names, proper indenting and white space. If you find that your program can be improved with a modification to your original description, include a paragraph to document the changes made.

Part 3 – Writing the Code [ 25 points ] 
Translate your pseudocode from Part 2 – Planning the Logic into Python code. Upload the .py file.

Part 4 – Testing the program [ 25 points ]
Describe how you tested your program from Part 3 – Writing the Code. Include the test data you used. State any limitations to your program: for example, document any types of user input that will “break” the program currently. Reflect on any debugging or maintenance you would wish to do if you were to put this program into production. (minimum 300 words)

*Be sure to review the rubric for each part before beginning*
